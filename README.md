## What's left?
The application is just a demo and was speedran in a week. Here's a list of important things that need to be implemented.
- User authentication
- Make the website fully responsive
- Implement better queries for performance
- Add a nasty search functionality

Not sure if I'll ever finish this project, we'll see what the future will bring to me.
